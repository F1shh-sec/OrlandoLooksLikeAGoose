            <h1>Goose Confirmation?</h1>
            <span>Recently there has been a conspiracy making its way around one of the Rochester Institute of Technology special interest houses. This conspiracy aims to draw similarities between the former E-House president, Elizabeth Orlando, and waterfowl. Now that sounds crazy at first, but the more you look into it, the more it makes sense. Think of it this way: have you ever seen Orlando in the same room as a goose? Come to realize, I never even saw a goose on floor. Do you think this is just a coincidence? We believe there are ulterior motives to Elizabeth <i>‘The Goose’</i> Orlando's strict “No geese on floor” policy. Think about it. If there were geese walking about, hanging out in the vax, and playing pool, we would quickly start to notice all the similarities between Orlando’s behaviour and that of a goose. Think. <b>THINK.</b> Why do you think Orlando was so scared to eat bread in front of people for the past year? She was still learning how to control those goose instincts. If we saw her hawking down a slice of white bread in one gulp, like a goose, her secret would be exposed. </span>

    <div class="row" id="TrueForm" style="margin-top: 2em">
        <div class="col-xl">
            <h1>Orlando's true form?</h1>
            <div class="RightL">The long orange bill of this goose draws a striking resemblance to Orlando's bill. Look at those small back eyes and tell me those do not look familiar! It's her!</div>
            <div class="RightL">The next point of focus is the long white, cylindrical neck. Doesn't that also look familiar? I would bet my life that I have seen that neck whip around the corner and pop into the pool lounge like a predator. There is just no way such a striking resemblance could be a coincidence. This has to be a picture of the former president, no doubt. The length of the neck is convincing enough, but combined with the long bill and black eyes that permanently stare into the abyss, it has to be her.</div>
            <div class="RightL">Finally, let's take a look at the body. The first thing that catches the eye is the striking neck to body height ratio. It looks like a snake trying to eat a rotisserie chicken. Does that description sound familiar? You were probably imagining Orlando doing that very thing as you read it. If that's the case, I don't think I need to do any more convincing. You now understand the truth.</div>
